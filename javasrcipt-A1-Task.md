- Video 1:
Just a simple video explaining that to watch them, we need to know a little bit about programming in general. Also, it is an introduction to all the persons that have participated in this serie of video.
- Video 2:
JavaScript is a programming language designed to interact with elements of a web page. We need to know JavaScript because it is everywhere (number 1 most used programming language in the world)
- Video 3:
This video shows the difference between the client JavaScript and the Server JavaScript (NodeJS). JavaScript on a client is to interact with the user interface on a website (with the DOM) and on a server, it is used to build web services.
- Videos 4 and 5:
This videos gives us the tools we need to code with JavaScript (VSS, extensions, NodeJS, WSL) and shows us how to install everything.
- Video 6:
Shows the very basics of JS/NodeJS. Shows the console.log(), the constants and how to print what we want.
- Videos 7 and 8:
Shows how to comment in a JS file. We can use single line(//) or multilines(/* */) comments. We should use fonctions to comment a function instead of every lines.
- Videos 9 and 10:
Show the 3 ways of declaring a variable : var (non used anymore), let (a variable) and const (a constant). The main difference between var and let is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
- Videos 11 and 12:
Shows how to concatenate strings. We can use "+" between two strings to concatenate them. 
- Videos 13 and 14:
Template literals is another way to formate strings. It works by inserting ${string}(it can be any types of variables) in a sentence we want to print.
- Videos 15 and 16:
In JS, we have to main parts of data types. The Simple ones and the Special ones. It exists only one type of number wich is a float type. But a variable can change types. It can even change types even if you don't ask for it. "==" just watch for the value and "===" watches also the type.
- Videos 17 and 18:
To do math, we can use simple operations, like addition, substraction, and so on. But we can also use operations like "++nbr" to increase the variable nbr by one and so on with the other operations. We can also use premade functions using the Math object.
- Videos 19 and 20:
To convert strigns to numbers, we can use parseInt() or parseFloat(). To do the opposite, we can use toString(). parseInt do not work with everything, like string that don't contain numbers. But it can understand hexadecimal. Also, we have to be careful about special signs in a string we want to convert.
- Videos 21 and 22:
To prevent errors without exceptions in the code, we can use try, catch and finally. Try catch and finally works together. Try test a part of code. If there is an error, we will see it thanks to "catch" and the code in the finally part will happend no matter if there is an error or not.
- Video 23 and 24:
In JS, time is an Object stored as a number in milliseconds since the first of january 1970. With the Date Object, the months starts with zero but when printed, it will be correct. We can either use "new Date()" or sets functions to create a new date object.
- Videos 25 and 26:
To compare values, we can use simple comparison (that are in every know programmation language) but we have to beware of the difference between the value comparison and the value and data type comparison. For if or if else statement, we can do it in one line.
- Videos 27 and 28:
This videos shows us how a variable is viewed in a boolean view. Some values like 0 or "" are named as False in a boolean way.Also, strings are case sensitive. To compare boolean,we can use && and || that means "and" and "or". We can also use switch to compare with a lot of different values at once.
- Videos 29 and 30:
An array can contain values of different types.We can create them by using "= []" or with the function Array(arrayLength). 
- Videos 31 and 32:
To access data in an array, we can use the index. We can also add a value using the index. If no value is at the index asked, it will return undefined.
- Videos 33 and 34:
In arrays, we can add or delete a value at the end using push and pop and we can do the same thing at the beginning of the array by using unshift and shift. We can also use concat to add many values at the end at once.
- Videos 35 and 36:
We can use the loop while when we don't know for how many iteration we want it to do the action wanted. We can use the for loop when we know how many time we want it to make the action. for ... of is used to go through a list of values.
- Videos 37 and 38:
Functions are used to keep the code understandable and for maintainability, to change an error in one place instead of many. We can make a function by using the keyword function and by wrtiting it like the following : function functionName(arguments). There exists a lot of different type of functions and different choices to create them.
- Videos 39 and 40:
Arrow functions permit us not to use the keywords function and return to declare a function and to return the result. It is an implicit return. 
- Videos 41 and 42:
JS is used on a client-server system. JSON is an independant language that can be used by every programmation language that can have more than 2 types of data.The JSON format uses name-value pairs. To convert a JS Object to JSON, we just need to put it as a string. To restore it we use JSON.parse.
- Videos 43 and 44:
JS Objects have properties and methods. To create Objects, we can use brackets or constructors. It is pretty much the same as what we call "Class" in other programmation language (python, C, Java for example). We can call a method on an object by inserting a dot between the name of the object and the method. obj.method() is calling the method named method of the object named obj.
- Videos 45 and 46:
Promises are better version of a callback. Because callback can be messy if you have successions of them. Promises works with a resolve-reject pair. We use then when the promise is working(using resolve) and catch when it is not(using reject)
